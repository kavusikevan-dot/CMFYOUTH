make the redirect url /about/
make the instagram button redirect to instagram.com/cmf.youth/
make the same thing you did with the about pages to every button
i want to make it so whenever i click one of the buttons, such as "about" and "events" it brings me to a subdirectory called that said button. I understand that this doesn't work on this space, but I want you to simulate it as if it was redirecting me to a subdirectory. Create and then on each of these pages create a full yellow page just so i know the subdirectory works.
perfect! now I want you to make it so the home buttons do not redirect, since we are already on the homepage, unless we are on a different page. Additionally, add a redirect for the "get involved" button and the same redirectory for the button "Donate now". Additionally, do this for the legal buttons. Finally, create the same header and footer for every redirect page as the header and footer on the home page
